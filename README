Math::LP::Solve is a wrapper for the functions in the lp_solve library for
solving linear programs, which is written by Michel Berkelaar. 
The source code of this library is available at ftp://ftp.ics.ele.tue.nl/pub/lp_solve/
The Perl extension is based on the latest version (lp_solve_3.0).

INSTALLATION

Download lp_solve_3.0.tar.gz and untar it in the Math-LP-Solve-* directory,
then compile the library (which requires some tweaking of the Makefile).
Consult the lp_solve documentation if any help is needed here. 

IMPORTANT: make sure the lp_solve library is compiled for position independent
           code (e.g. by including -fPIC in the CFLAGS for gcc).

If you already have a compiled version of the library, it suffices to
make a directory lp_solve_3.0 and copy liblpk.a and all .h files to it.

Alternatively, the whole download - extraction - compilation sequence
is performed automatically if the needed files are not found. This may
fail at some step however, whereafter you'll need to revert to the manual
method.

In short, the standard sequence for installing Perl extensions should
do the job:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

Automatic compilation of the lp_solve library is attempted in the first
of these steps.

If you do not have write access to the Perl libraries, it is still possible
to install it in a separate location with absolute pathname <dir> using the
following sequence:

	% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<dir> LIB=<dir>/lib/perl5
	% make
	% make test
	% make pure_install

Do not forget to include <dir> in your PERL5LIB search path to use the
extension in this case.
